# UniFi Terraform Provider

A Terraform provider for managing Ubiquiti's UniFi network controller. This provider allows you to automate 
the configuration of your UniFi network infrastructure using Terraform.

**Note:** You can't configure your network while connected to something that may disconnect (like WiFi). 
Use a hard-wired connection to your controller to use this provider.

## Features

- Manage UniFi network resources using Infrastructure as Code
- Support for **UniFi Controller version 6.x and later**
- Compatible with UDM, UDM-Pro, UCG, and standard controller deployments
- Comprehensive resource management including:
    - Network/WLAN configuration
    - Firewall rules
    - Port forwarding
    - DNS records
    - User management
    - And more...

## Installation

### From This Fork (Recommended)

This fork includes bug fixes not yet in the upstream provider. To install:

1. Build the provider:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shadyeip/terraform-provider-unifi.git
   cd terraform-provider-unifi
   go build -o terraform-provider-unifi
   ```

2. Create the plugin directory and copy the binary:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/filipowm/unifi/99.0.0/darwin_arm64
   cp terraform-provider-unifi ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/filipowm/unifi/99.0.0/darwin_arm64/
   ```

   Replace `darwin_arm64` with your platform:
   - `darwin_amd64` - macOS Intel
   - `linux_amd64` - Linux x86_64
   - `linux_arm64` - Linux ARM64

3. Configure Terraform to use the local provider:
   ```hcl
   terraform {
       required_providers {
           unifi = {
               source  = "filipowm/unifi"
               version = "99.0.0"
           }
       }
   }
   ```

4. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   rm -f .terraform.lock.hcl
   terraform init
   ```

### From Terraform Registry

The provider is available in the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/filipowm/unifi/latest). To use it in your Terraform configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
    required_providers {
        unifi = {
            source  = "filipowm/unifi"
            version = "~> 1.0.0"  # Use the latest version
        }
    }
}
```

## Authentication

The provider supports two authentication methods:

1. Username/Password authentication
2. API Key authentication (requires controller version 9.0.108 or later)

```hcl
# Using environment variables (recommended)
# Export these variables:
# export UNIFI_API_KEY="my-api-key"
# export UNIFI_USERNAME="admin"
# export UNIFI_PASSWORD="password"
# export UNIFI_API="https://unifi.example.com:8443"
# export UNIFI_INSECURE=true  # Only if using self-signed certificates

# Or configure directly in the provider block
provider "unifi" {
    api_key = "my-api-key"
    # username = "admin" # Use either username/password or API key
    # password = "password"
    api_url = "https://unifi.example.com:8443"

    # Optional settings
    allow_insecure = true  # For self-signed certificates
    site = "default"       # Specify non-default site
}
```

## Example Usage

Here's a basic example of creating a wireless network:

```hcl
resource "unifi_wlan" "wifi" {
    name       = "My WiFi Network"
    security   = "wpa2"
    passphrase = "mystrongpassword"
    network_id = unifi_network.vlan_50.id
}

resource "unifi_network" "vlan_50" {
    name    = "VLAN 50"
    purpose = "corporate"
    subnet  = "10.0.50.0/24"
    vlan_id = 50
}
```

More examples can be found in the [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/filipowm/unifi/latest/docs).
